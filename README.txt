Professional User Management — Restyled
======================================

This package contains a modern, responsive redesign of your original project.

Files
-----
- index.html              → Landing page
- login.html              → Auth (login)
- register.html           → Auth (register)
- profile.html            → Profile editor
- admin-dashboard.html    → Admin dashboard with sidebar, header, stat cards, and a users table
- styles.css              → Modern dark UI, responsive
- app.js                  → Vanilla JS demo logic using localStorage

How to Use
----------
1. Open **index.html** in a browser.
2. Click **Get Started** to register or **Sign in** to go straight to the dashboard (demo auth).
3. In the dashboard:
   - Use **Seed demo users** to add sample data.
   - Use **Search** or **Filter** to find users.
   - **Add user**, **Edit**, **Delete** are client-side (localStorage).

Notes
-----
- No external libraries required.
- Charts intentionally omitted as requested (cards + table only).
- Mobile responsive: sidebar collapses via the ☰ button.
